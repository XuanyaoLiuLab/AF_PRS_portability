# AF_PRS_portability
Codes used in the Allele frequency differences of causal variants have a major impact on low cross-ancestry portability of PRS project
The code for gene expression profiling, eQTL calling, Genetic correlation analysis, varLD analysis and cis-eQTL fine-mapping can be found in:https://mariesaitou.github.io/two_pop_eQTL/

The code for simulations of genetic correlation estimation biases, GxEMM analysis estimating h2_hom and h2_het and PRS prediction using elastic net can be found above
